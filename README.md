## About the Game

This C program simulates a classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The computer randomly selects one of the three options, and the player makes a choice. The winner is determined based on the rules:

- Rock crushes Scissors (Rock wins)
- Scissors cut Paper (Scissors win)
- Paper covers Rock (Paper wins)

Compile the source code using a C compiler. For example, using GCC:

```bash
gcc rock_paper_scissors.c -o rps
```

Run the compiled executable:

```bash
./rps
```

## Note

This game will run indefinitely until manually terminated.

Feel free to enhance or modify the code and contribute to the project.

Happy gaming! ðŸŽ®
